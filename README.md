## CyniaAI WebApp

> [!WARNING]
> There're big differences between *BukkitGPT-v3 WebUI* and *CyniaAI WebApp*. BukkitGPT is a self-hosted, free, open-source, community-driven project, while CyniaAI WebApp is a paid, cloud-hosted service that provides a more user-friendly experience for non-developers.
> Issues and questions about CyniaAI WebApp should be directed to our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kTZtXw8s7r).

Don't want to deal with Python, Maven, BuildTools, and other complicated environments?
Hey! Here's [the CyniaAI WebApp](https://cynia.dev) designed just for you - generate plugins **even on your phone**!

*The service is paid since the API key we are using is not free. You can get 1 key for 5 generations for $1 [here](https://afdian.com/item/b839835461e311efbd1252540025c377)

*The WebApp edition doesn't support plugin editing feature yet, but we are working on it.

## Features

- Automatically generate plugin code based on the user's description.
- Edit existing plugins.
- Brand new Streamlit UI.

## Requirements
You can use BukkitGPT on any computer with [Java](https://www.azul.com/downloads/), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/) **AND** [BuildTools](https://github.com/CyniaAI/BukkitGPT-v3#the-pom-for-orgspigotmcspigotjar1132-r01-snapshot-is-missing) installed. 

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies with command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyniaAI/BukkitGPT-v3
cd BukkitGPT-v3
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # for Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it to set `LLM_PROVIDER` (e.g. `openai`, `anthropic`, `google`) and fill in your provider API key.
3. Run bash command `streamlit web.py` to start the web application.
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the web application.
5. Enjoy!

## Troubleshooting

### The POM for org.spigotmc:spigot:jar:1.13.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT is missing
1. [Download BuildTools](https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/BuildTools.jar) and place it in *an empty folder*.
2. Open the file.
3. Choose `1.13.2` in `Settings/Select Version`.
4. Click `Compile` in the bottom right corner and let it finish.
5. Go to your BukkitGPT folder, execute `build.bat` in `projects/<artifact_name_of_your_plugin>`.
6. You'll find your plugin in `projects/<artifact_name_of_your_plugin>/target` folder.

### 'mvn' is not recognized as an internal or external command

** If you have not installed Maven, please follow the steps below: **
1. Make sure you have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed.
2. Add the Maven `bin` directory to your system `PATH` environment variable.
3. Restart your terminal or command prompt.

** If you are sure that you installed Maven and it does work everywhere else, but not in BukkitGPT-v3: **

Sometimes the terminal does not use the system `PATH` environment variable, so you need to set it manually. You can do this by adding the following line to your `.env` file:

```plaintext
PATH=/path/to/maven/bin:$PATH
```
