# Choose your provider (openai, anthropic, or google) and fill in the API key.
# For OpenAI-compatible providers, like OpenRouter and Ollama, set LLM_PROVIDER to openai and change the BASE_URL to the provider's API endpoint.
#
# Note: The default generation model, which is set to `deepseek/deepseek-r1:free`, is free to use on OpenRouter but not recommended for advanced use.
#       We highly recommend using a paid model for better performance.
#       Here are some recommended models:
#       ‚ù§ google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20:thinking (Fast, cheapest and good for most tasks)
#       openai/o4-mini (Fast, cheap and great for complex tasks)
#       anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 (Expensive and for the extremely complex tasks)
